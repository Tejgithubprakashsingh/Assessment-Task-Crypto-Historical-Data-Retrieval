1. Data Structure
The data is historical cryptocurrency price data for a chosen crypto pair (e.g., BTC/USD) from a specified start date to the current date. Each row represents a day and includes various calculated features used for both analysis and machine learning predictions.

2. Columns in the Data
The main columns in the dataset can be divided into three categories:

a) Basic Price Data
These columns provide the daily price values:

Date: The specific day for each data entry.
Open: The opening price of the cryptocurrency on that day.
High: The highest price reached on that day.
Low: The lowest price reached on that day.
Close: The closing price of the cryptocurrency on that day.
b) Rolling Metrics (Historical and Future)
These metrics are calculated based on past variable1 days (e.g., 7 days) and future variable2 days (e.g., 5 days). They include:

High_Last_{variable1}_Days: The highest price observed over the past variable1 days.
Low_Last_{variable1}_Days: The lowest price observed over the past variable1 days.
Days_Since_High_Last_{variable1}_Days: The number of days since the most recent high price in the last variable1 days.
Days_Since_Low_Last_{variable1}_Days: The number of days since the most recent low price in the last variable1 days.
%Diff_From_High_Last{variable1}_Days: The percentage difference between the current close price and the highest price over the past variable1 days.
%Diff_From_Low_Last{variable1}_Days: The percentage difference between the current close price and the lowest price over the past variable1 days.
c) Future Predictions
These columns are calculated based on future prices over the next variable2 days and will be used as target variables in the model:

High_Next_{variable2}_Days: The highest price expected in the next variable2 days.
Low_Next_{variable2}_Days: The lowest price expected in the next variable2 days.
%Diff_From_High_Next{variable2}_Days: The percentage difference between the current close price and the highest price over the next variable2 days.
%Diff_From_Low_Next{variable2}_Days: The percentage difference between the current close price and the lowest price over the next variable2 days.
3. Target Variables for Prediction
The machine learning model is trained to predict the following two target variables:

%Diff_From_High_Next{variable2}_Days: Predicted future percentage difference from the high price in the next variable2 days.
%Diff_From_Low_Next{variable2}_Days: Predicted future percentage difference from the low price in the next variable2 days.
4. Features for Model Training
The model uses four main features to make predictions:

Days_Since_High_Last_{variable1}_Days
%Diff_From_High_Last{variable1}_Days
Days_Since_Low_Last_{variable1}_Days
%Diff_From_Low_Last{variable1}_Days
5. Example Data Row
For a hypothetical day, a row might look like this:

Date	Open	High	Low	Close	High_Last_7_Days	Low_Last_7_Days	Days_Since_High_Last_7_Days	%_Diff_From_High_Last_7_Days	...
2023-01-10	41000	42000	40000	41500	42500	39500	2	-2.35
